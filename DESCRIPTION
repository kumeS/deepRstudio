Description: Enhancing cross-language compatibility within the RStudio environment and supporting seamless language understanding, 
    the deepRstudio package leverages the power of the 'DeepL' API (see <https://www.deepl.com/docs-api>) to 
    enable seamless, fast, accurate, and affordable translation of code comments, documents, and text. 
    This package offers the ability to translate selected text into English, 
    as well as from English (EN) into various languages, namely Japanese (JA), Chinese (ZH), Spanish (ES), 
    French (FR), Russian (RU), Portuguese (PT), and Indonesian (ID). 
    With much of the text being written in English, the emphasis is on compatibility from English. 
    It is also designed for developers working on multilingual projects and data analysts collaborating with international teams, 
    simplifying the translation process and making code more accessible and comprehensible to people with diverse language backgrounds. 
    This package uses 'rstudioapi' package and 'DeepL' API, and is simply implemented, executed from addins or via shortcuts on RStudio. 
    With just a few steps, content can be translated between supported languages, promoting better collaboration 
    and expanding the global reach of work. The functionality of this package works only on RStudio using rstudioapi.
